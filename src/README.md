This class is used to import an XML file from Dealer Car Search into a worksforweb.com (iAuto) classifieds listing.  There is some basic logging, and it's pretty straight forward to extend.  The main methods that would need to be overridden are the getListing*() methods as they map how the data is keyed in the source file.
